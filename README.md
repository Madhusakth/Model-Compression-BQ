# Model-Compression-BQ

This is the implementation of B&Q algorithm from Speech Recogniton Model Compression (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053927). 
In the original paper, we tested our algorithm on 4 models: 1. Speech command recognition, 2. DeepSpeech, 3. DeepSpeech2, 4. VGG16. 

In this repository, the automated code for B&Q will be shown for applying it as a standalone technique on multiple trained models.
